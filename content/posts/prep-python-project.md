Here is how I prepare `python` projects.

## Assuming Python3 is already installed

I uses `python3` installed by default via OS package. or `brew python3`
(But if I have a chance to use `conda` and the others, I may try)

## Create python3 virtual environment

I uses `venv` module

- Create `venv`
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```
- Activate `venv`
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- Here you have **Isolated environment** you can experiment, not affecting entire OS.

## Install pip and pip-tools

- Upgrade `pip` to latest version
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- Install `pip-tools` for dependencies management
  ```bash
  pip install pip-tools
  ```
- for more information about `pip-tools` see https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/

## Installing libraries

- Create `requirements.in` file.
  ```
  django>=2.2,<3.0
  ```
- Run `pip-compile`
  ```
  pip-compile
  ```
- You can check `cat requirements.txt`
  ```
  #
  # This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with python 3.10
  # To update, run:
  #
  #    pip-compile
  #
  django==2.2.28
      # via -r requirements.in
  pytz==2022.1
      # via django
  sqlparse==0.4.2
      # via django
  ```
- Install libraries using `pip install`
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- You can check installed libraries by `pip list`
  ```
